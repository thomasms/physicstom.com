First entry of 2020 and it's a very lazy one. But it points to non lazy content. 

A few slides and extensive examples (in C++) on SOLID software design.
They are on my GitHub pages [here](https://thomasms.github.io/solidslides). At some point it would be good to add them to this blog directly.

Here's a picture of a programmer (who I hope is practicing SOLID programming principles).

Enjoy.
